============

UnisensViewer has been developed for easy handling of multi sensor data stored in the Unisens data format directly after the recording as well as for data visualization. The workflow is simplified by a software-based solution for editing and creating of meta data for data sets. This meta data is stored in the Unisens data format. Moreover, UnisensViewer allows to easily edit measurement data. Additionally, the user interface can be used to display information about selected measurement data as well as annotations. Visualization of multiple sensor data can be done synchronous and in parallel.
